# Small Eventz

## Description
This is a prototype of the “Small Events” app that enables people to find a jogging partner, group exercising, stand-up comedy, someone to do a shopping with, etc. basically anything that people would like to find someone to hang out with. Users will register and create a profile, to be able to post events. The events once posted, will be shown on the map by city, as per the event’s location. As a scope for future development, the users who posted and/or participated in 10 events will receive a start which can be converted to something else.

## Installation
You can check the website at this link: https://incandescent-fudge-d0a729.netlify.app/ 

## Usage
To use Small Eventz, you need to create an account or if you've alreayd created one, log into the website. Then you can see your User Profile as well as a section to create an event.

To create an event, you need to write in a simple title, a descrption of what the event is about and who it would be for as well as the location by city. For future developments, we hope to make it more specific to the exact address.

After creating it, you can see your event posted in Explore, where you can see other events as well as a map display of the location they're based in.
